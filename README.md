# openTelemac River Delta Model

## Overview
This repository contains the openTelemac model code for simulating the hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes in river deltas. The model aims to provide insights into delta formation, evolution, and the impact of various environmental factors.

## Features
- **Hydrodynamic Simulation**: Utilizes the openTelemac 2D/3D solvers to model water flow dynamics.
- **Sediment Transport**: Includes sediment transport algorithms to simulate erosion and deposition.
- **Delta Evolution**: Models the long-term evolution of river deltas under different scenarios.
- **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Assesses the impact of human activities and climate change on delta morphology.

## Installation
To use this model, please ensure you have openTelemac installed on your system. Follow the installation guide provided by openTelemac for your specific platform.
